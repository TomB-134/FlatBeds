The flat beds resource pack introduces flat bed icons from the bedrock edition into java edition.

This project had gradle tasks designed to zip the texture packs automatically, meaning if you wanted to create a custom flat beds texture pack this could also work for your needs.

Currently supported packs include:
* Default/x16 - Textures from Bedrock Edition
* Faithful/x32 - Textures from [Faithful x32 BE](http://tiny.cc/faithful-bedrock)
* Bare Bones - Textures from [Bare Bones BE](https://mcpedl.com/bare-bones-be/)

Simply click on the version you want to download, and the newest version will be downloaded.
